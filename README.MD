## ○ Final Capstone - T51

This project required me to write an application that carried out the analysis and comparison of two clustering techniques on the dataset in the file UsArrests.csv.  The data describes statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.

The application carries out a PCA analysis and then a final comparative analysis on the two different clustering techniques used (K-means and Hierarchical).

The screenshot below contains a statistical comparison of where the two techniques differed in their classifications.
Of the 50 states (although they are described as cities in the data), the two clustering techniques diagreed on 6 entries.  A statistical analysis of the six is displayed below along with the comparable data for the entire dataset.  This is explained in more detail in the Jupyter file (T51CapstonePVII.ipynb).
