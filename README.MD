## ○ Final Capstone - T51

This project analyses and compares two clustering techniques on the dataset in the file UsArrests.csv.  The data describes statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents,
for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.

The program carries out a PCA analysis and then a final comparative analysis on two different clustering teachniques used (K-means and Hierarchical) 

The screenshot below contains a statistical comparison of where the two techniques differed in their classifications.
Of the 50 states (although they are described as cities in the data), the two clustering techniques diagreed on 6 entries.  A statistical analysis of the six is diaplyed below along with the comparable data for the entire dataset.  This is explained in more detail in the Jupyter file (T51CapstonePVII.ipynb).
