## ○ Final Capstone - T51

This project analyses and compares two clustering techniques on the dataset in the file UsArrests.csv.  It  carries out a PCA analysis
and then a final comparative analysis on two different clustering teachniques used (K-means and Hierarchical) 

The screenshot below contains a statistical comparison of where the two techniques differed in their classifications.
Of the 51 States (although they are described as cities in the data), the two clustering techniques diagreed on 6 entries.  A statistical analysis of the six is diaplyed below along with the comparable data for the entire dataset.  This is explained in more detail in the Jupyter file (.ipynb).
